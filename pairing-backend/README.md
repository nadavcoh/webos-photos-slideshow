# Pairing backend

A tiny bridge between a standard Google OAuth Authorization Code flow
(required for the Photos Picker API scope, which Google doesn't allow
over the Device Authorization Grant) and the TV app, using short-lived
pairing codes. Four serverless functions, no framework, no build step.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/start?state=<code>&key=<shared secret>` — redirects the
  phone to Google's consent screen. Refuses (403) unless `key` matches
  `PAIRING_SHARED_SECRET` — see **Security notes** below.
- `GET /api/callback` — Google redirects here after consent; verifies
  the signed `state`, exchanges the code for tokens, creates a Picker
  session, stashes both in KV keyed by the pairing code, then redirects
  the phone straight into the picker.
- `GET /api/poll?state=<code>` — the TV polls this until pairing
  completes (202 while waiting, 200 with tokens once ready, single-use).
- `POST /api/refresh` — the TV calls this to refresh its access token
  without ever holding the client secret itself.

## Deploy

1. **Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth
   client ID** → Application type: **Web application** (not "TVs and
   Limited Input devices" — that type doesn't support this flow).
   Leave it open for now; the redirect URI goes in after step 3.
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → enable **Google Photos Picker API**,
   if you haven't already for this project.
3. Deploy this directory as its own Vercel project:
   ```bash
   cd pairing-backend
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```
   Or connect the repo in the Vercel dashboard and set this directory
   (`pairing-backend/`) as the project's root directory.
4. Note the resulting domain (e.g. `your-project.vercel.app`), go back
   to the OAuth client from step 1, and add this as an **Authorized
   redirect URI**:
   ```
   https://your-project.vercel.app/api/callback
   ```
5. **Vercel project → Storage → Create Database → KV** (this is Vercel
   KV / Upstash Redis under the hood) and connect it to this project —
   it auto-injects the `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` env vars
   that `@vercel/kv` needs.
6. **Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables**, add:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` = `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/callback`
     (must match step 4 exactly, including scheme and no trailing slash)
   - `PAIRING_SHARED_SECRET` — any long random string you generate
     yourself, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`. This is what stops a
     stranger who finds your `.vercel.app` URL from starting OAuth
     consent flows against your Google Cloud project — see **Security
     notes**.
7. Redeploy after adding the env vars so the functions pick them up.
8. Put the resulting base URL (`https://your-project.vercel.app`, no
   trailing slash) and the `PAIRING_SHARED_SECRET` value into the TV
   app's config — either `src/secrets.local.js` for local testing, or
   the `PAIRING_BACKEND_URL` / `PAIRING_SHARED_SECRET` GitHub repo
   secrets for automated deploys. See the main README.

## Security notes

- **`PAIRING_SHARED_SECRET`** gates `/api/start`: without the matching
  `key` query param, the endpoint refuses outright (403) before it ever
  redirects to Google. The secret is also used to HMAC-sign the `state`
  value handed to Google, and `/api/callback` verifies that signature
  before doing anything — so even someone who copies your public
  `client_id` and hits Google's consent screen directly, skipping
  `/api/start` entirely, can't produce a `state` that `/api/callback`
  will accept. Together these stop casual/automated discovery of your
  backend's public URL from being usable to spin up consent flows
  against your Google Cloud project (burning quota, or looking like
  abuse to Google at volume).

  Caveat: this secret ships inside the packaged TV app, same as any
  client-side secret — someone with your actual `.ipk` file could
  extract it. It raises the bar against casual/remote discovery; it's
  not a defense against someone who already has physical access to
  your TV.
- The `state` pairing code (the part before `PAIRING_SHARED_SECRET`
  gets involved) is itself the only thing standing between "the TV that
  generated it" and "whoever calls /api/poll with it" — treat it like a
  short-lived bearer credential. It's random (via the TV's `uuidv4()`),
  single-use (deleted on first successful poll), and expires after 10
  minutes in KV even if never collected.
- The client secret only ever exists in this backend's environment
  variables — it's never sent to, or stored by, the TV app.
- `prompt=consent` on every `/api/start` redirect means re-pairing
  always issues a fresh refresh token; Google would otherwise omit it
  on repeat consents for the same account.
